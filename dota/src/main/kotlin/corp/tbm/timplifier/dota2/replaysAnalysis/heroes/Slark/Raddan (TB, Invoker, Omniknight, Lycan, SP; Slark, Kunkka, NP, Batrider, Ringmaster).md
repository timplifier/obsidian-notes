This is my first note about watched replay. Here is some breakdown for the first 15 minutes:

# Items
Here is a breakdown of itemisation on lane
1. Buys stats to skirmish because Slark loves tempo. (2 Wraith Bands, Magic Stick)
2. Always buys regen when low hp (usually Tango)
3. Rushes PT, Diffusal and Aghanim (META)

# Laning
1. Seeking for skirmishes because of essence shift, which steals stats, therefore deals additional damage (12 damage on first lvl; 48 damage on fourth lvl). So he always has +12 damage on hit, also makes him stronger for 30 seconds
2. Doesn't press Dark Pact immediately, waits for some debuffs to purge and usually presses Dark Pact when Pounce ends

# Mid Game
1. Waits until Diffusal; doesn't TP for fight until diffusal
2. Doesn't farm triangle at all due to low damage to ancients and 0 items for farm (Maelstrom, Battle Fury)
3. Participates almost in every skirmish due to high Slark tempo.
